Hello,

    If you are reading this, chances are you are trying to use my Excel Sheet Processor for the One Stop
office at Santa Clara University. I created this program in the Fall of 2019 to save time for the student
employees by automatically processing all of the Excel sheets which we used to have to process by hand.
This process would normally take a few minutes per sheet, whereas now it takes a few seconds per month.

    I hope that this program comes to great use at the office, and let it be known how many poor hand,
wrist, and finger tendons had been sacrificed before this was made.

    Put me to good use.
